## Emoji Hunt
Description
Emoji Hunt is a simple computer vision application that uses the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm to detect and locate emojis within an image. The application was developed using Python 3 and OpenCV, and was trained using a dataset of various emoji images.
